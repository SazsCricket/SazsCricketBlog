Today's game will see two teams which have gone through very contrasting ways to reach here. The PBKS started the season pretty well but gradually went into a slump. CSK, on the other hand, started their campaign with four successive defeats before gaining some mojo back in the last three games. Moreover,  it won't be wrong to say the momentum is with CSK with the finish CSK had in the previous match against their arch-rivals. However, PBKS, with their mantra for this season, "All out attack", can take down any team on their day. Both the teams have a lot at stake depending on today's result; therefore, we can be sure about witnessing a great fight between the two.

Today's match will be the second instance these two teams meet each other this season, with the first one won by PBKS comprehensively. Their bowling during the powerplay won them the game last time, and they would badly want the bowling to repeat the same tonight. PBKS, also with their ultra-aggressive approach, have constantly failed to bat out whole innings. This approach would be great if all the batters consistently score runs while being aggressive. However, most batters getting out without scoring runs while trying to be aggressive has hurt them. Suppose they still want to follow the same formula. In that case, they can bring in Bhanuka Rajapaksha for Nathan Ellis and Rishi Dhawan for Sharukh Khan. With these changes, they can bring in a left-handed batter in the middle, which they are dearly missing and an allrounder who can bat down the order and bowl in the powerplays. Rishi Dhawan has been doing pretty well in the domestic circuit. He has the experience to emulate it at this level. Bringing in Rishi Dhawan also helps them use Kagiso Rabada in the middle and death overs where he is at his best. Rabada, in tandem with Arshdeep Singh in death will be a very effective combo.

Like MS Dhoni said in 2020, CSK was a boat full of holes, and if they plugged one hole, some other opened up. Even their coach Stephen Fleming said they had issues in all three departments. Still, CSK, unlike 2020, has started finding the solutions to its problems. For instance, the move to bring in Theekshana to bowl in powerplay has reduced the damage inflicted during this phase. Mukesh Choudhary coming good has also helped their cause. That change also allowed them to use Bravo in the middle and death overs rather than using him in and around powerplay. With both Bravo and Pretorius doing well in the death, CSK's bowling looks a bit more settled than what it looked like before. On the other hand, their batting still hasn't fired enough, barring a few instances. But we can expect them to be good with the lineup's experience. The fielding has been mediocre for a long time, and they would like to improve it in tonight's game. CSK brought in Mitchell Santner for Moeen Ali in the last game against MI to counter the right-handed batter heavy batting lineup. With PBKS too lacking left-handed batters in their lineup, CSK could use the same tactic in today's fixture. 

Both the teams have their flaws, and it would be interesting to see whose flaws are exposed and whose are amended.

Stats to Note :
-       Shikhar Dhawan needs just 59 more runs (941 currently) to score 1000 runs against CSK (his highest against any opponent
-       Dwaine Pretorius has managed to keep down Liam Livingstone till now. The Batter has a strike rate of just 81.25 against Pretorius. Pretorius has also dismissed Livingstone twice in the four outings they have faced.
